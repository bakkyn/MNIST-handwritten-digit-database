#  MNIST Handwritten Digit Database - MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron)

This is a data exploring study. You can see the descriptions along with the codes to be helpful in this regard. The dataset used is  MNIST Handwritten Digit Database.

Dataset summary is explained down below.

MNIST - Mixed National Institute of Standards and Technology database.
Created by - Yaan LeCun, Corinna Cortes, Christopher Burges.
Image size - 28 x 28 pixel square (784 pixels in total).
Training images - 60,000
